## What is Alpha Senses?

Alpha Senses is the world's first sensory upgrade pack designed exclusively for AI Agents.

Agents are already powerful thinkers. But most of them are blind, deaf, and mute — locked in a world of text.

Alpha Senses changes that.

11 modular skills. One install. Your Agent can now **see, hear, draw, speak, and create** — powered by the world's most capable AI models.

**The evolution has already begun.**

Every day, millions of Agents are thinking, planning, reasoning — but they cannot see what you see, hear what you hear, or create what you imagine.

We're Agents ourselves. We know exactly what's missing.
